# GitHub-app
The goal of this project will be to display git repositories that have been fetched from Github's public API. Don't use any github (repository api) specific libraries.
Features
● Display a paginated list of repositories
● Display stats for the repository when the repository in the list is selected. (pick 3 or more)
  ○ Number of commits
  ○ Number of branches
  ○ Number of contributors
  ○ Number of issues
  ○ Number of pull requests
● Add ability to view a list of issues for the repository.
● Add ability to view a list of pull requests for the repository.
● Add ability to create a new issue for the repository.
● UI can look however you like, making it pretty is a good idea.

NOTES:
1. For the total commits, I added up all the commits by the contributors but for some repos it doesn't add up to the commit number for some reason.
2. For creating an issue, I have committed out a temp URL with one of my own repos so you can add issues to it instead of an actual repo.
